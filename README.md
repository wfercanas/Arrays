# Arrays

### Difficulty: âšª Very Easy

## Project URL

ðŸš€ You can check a single example of array manipulation --forEach()-- to render a todo app in the following link: https://wfercanas.github.io/Arrays/client/01-for-each.html

To check the code [click here](https://github.com/wfercanas/Arrays/blob/main/server/01-for-each-challenge.js).

## Project Description

This project was develop to practice some array methods, the ones that are probably the most commonly used on a daily basis.
Here you will find separate files for different methods, each of them presenting not only the specific method in use but also how to make it work in the same way using only a for-loop.

## Technologies used

JavaScript

## Special Challenges

For certain methods, you will find files that contain the word 'challenge' in its name. Such files present a little more complex situation where you can explore a not so common use case of the method.

## Key concepts

These are the methods included in this project:

1. forEach()
2. map()
3. filter()
4. reduce()
5. some()
6. every()
7. find()
8. findIndex()
9. includes()
10. join()
11. concat()
12. flat()
13. flatMap()
14. sort()
